# The React frontend, built once and served as static files.

# Two stages: Node builds the bundle, nginx serves it. The Node toolchain
# never reaches the runtime image -- a production container that ships npm and
# a full node_modules tree is ~400 MB of attack surface for zero benefit, since
# nothing is compiled after the build.
#
# Vite inlines `import.meta.env.VITE_*` at build time, so these are build args
# rather than runtime environment. Changing one means rebuilding the image;
# that is the trade for a fully static, cacheable bundle.
