"""Projects, drawings and revision history.

The tables, repositories and `RegisterRevision` all existed; nothing reached
them over HTTP. So a project could be created only by a direct database
write, and a drawing's revision history -- the thing a steel practice
actually navigates by -- could not be read at all.

Every route here enforces membership rather than trusting the request.
Project membership is an access scope, not a label: a caller who is not a
member gets **404, not 403**, matching the convention the documents routes
already use. A 403 confirms the project exists, which is itself a leak when
client names are commercially sensitive.

Membership is checked *in addition to* platform clearance, never instead of
it. A project member still cannot read a document classified above their
clearance -- the two dimensions are independent and both must pass.
