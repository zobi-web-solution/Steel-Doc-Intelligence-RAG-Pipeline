"""Structured search and facets.

Separate from `/chat` on purpose. Chat is a question answered from
documents; this is a filter sidebar over a corpus -- "show me every drawing
in project 2024-0117 that references ISMB 300". A drawing register is
browsed as much as it is asked questions, and routing that through an LLM
would be slower, costlier and less exact than a keyword filter.

Both endpoints apply the caller's access scope and clearance, so a facet
list can never reveal that a project, drawing or part exists that the caller
is not allowed to read.
