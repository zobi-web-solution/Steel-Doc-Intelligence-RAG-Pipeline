"""Prometheus metric definitions.

Every metric declared here MUST be recorded somewhere — a declared-but-never
incremented metric reads as "0, everything is fine" on a dashboard, which is
worse than having no metric at all. `scripts/check_governance.py` enforces
this by failing CI when a metric has no recording call site.

Metrics referenced by `docs/governance/risk_register.yaml` are additionally
checked to exist here, so a risk can never point at a metric nobody emits.
