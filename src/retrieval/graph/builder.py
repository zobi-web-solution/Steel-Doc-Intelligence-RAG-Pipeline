"""Assembles the query graph.

This replaces control flow that was previously spread across five methods of
`QueryPipeline`, each an async generator delegating to the next, with early
returns at eight different points. The branching was correct but only
legible by reading all five in order; here the same decisions are edges you
can see at once -- and the fallback from a failed tool back into full
retrieval, which was a recursive call into another generator, is just an
edge.
