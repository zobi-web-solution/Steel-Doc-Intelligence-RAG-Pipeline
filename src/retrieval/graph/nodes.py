"""Graph nodes for the query pipeline.

Each node is a thin function over the components `QueryPipeline` already
owns. That split is deliberate: the graph owns *control flow* (which was
previously a nest of early returns and delegating async generators spread
across five methods), and the pipeline continues to own *components* and the
governance helpers. Nothing about how a chunk is retrieved, compressed,
redacted or checked changed here -- only how the steps are sequenced.

Nodes emit SSE-shaped events through LangGraph's custom stream writer, so
the event contract the chat route and the UI consume is unchanged.
