"""Projects, members, drawings and revision history.

The tables and repositories existed all along; nothing reached them over
HTTP, so a project could only be created by a direct database write and a
drawing's revision history could not be read at all.

The access tests are the point of this file. Project membership is a scope,
and a non-member must get 404 rather than 403 -- a 403 confirms the project
exists, which is itself a leak when client names are commercially sensitive.
