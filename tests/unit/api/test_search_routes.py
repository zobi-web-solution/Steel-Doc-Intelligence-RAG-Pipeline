"""The structured-search endpoints.

These had no tests at all: the repository layer was covered, the routes were
not, and both of the bugs found here were in the route -- the router was
registered but never `include_router`'d, and the access filter could be
widened by the client. Neither is visible from a repository test.

The repositories are faked, because what is under test is the translation
from request to filter: which fields are honoured, and -- far more
importantly -- which are not.
